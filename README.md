# TIC-TAC-CSS

This variation of the classic children's game demonstrates some of the fun things that can be done
graphically using CSS. X's, O's and the game board are represented with borders, shapes and transformations. 
Hover effects are applied over each section of the game board and are applied onClick for the remainder of
the round.

Each game begins with X's turn. Hover over a space in the game board to see the X stencil, click the space to 
apply your stamp to that space and move on to the next turn. The game will end in a win for X, win for O, 
or a draw. It will offer you the option to restart the game.
