# TIC-TAC-CSS

This variation of the classic children's game demonstrates the graphical
capabilities of CSS. X's, O's and the game board are represented with borders
shapes and transformations thereof. Hover effects are applied over each
section of the game board and are applied onClick for the reamineder of
the round.

Each game begins with X's turn. Hover over a space in the game board to see the X
stencil, click the space to apply your stamp to that space and move on to the next
turn. The game will end in a win for X, win for O, or a draw. It will offer you the
option to restart the game.
